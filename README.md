# Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built using FastAPI, SQLModel, Docker, and Cloudflare. The app provides a RESTful API for managing tasks, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete Todos.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **SQLModel**: Combines the best features of SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, simplifying database interactions.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Cloudflare**: Securely exposes the application to the internet using Cloudflare Tunnels.

## Installation
